                        With one that saw him die, who did report<br>
                        That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,<br>
                        Implored your Highness' pardon, and set forth<br>
                        A deep repentance. Nothing in his life<br>
                        Became him like the leaving it; he died<br>
                        As one that had been studied in his death,<br>
                        To throw away the dearest thing he owed<br>
                        As 'twere a careless trifle.
